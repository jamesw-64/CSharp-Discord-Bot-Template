# DiscordBot
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jamesw-64/DiscordBot.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.com/jamesw-64/DiscordBot)

A little attempt at making a Discord bot. Might use what I learn here to make something more useful

## Stopcodes
Here are the stopcodes that are used by the program when exiting prematurely:
 - Stopcode 1: Did not find token.txt, program exited
 - Stopcode 2: Invalid user input, program exited
 - Stopcode 3: token updated at user prompt, program restarted
 - Stopcode 4: General, unhandled error

Please do not change the bot's compiled EXE file name, or any other file name, as doing so will cause issues. Bugs submitted with modified file names will not be investigated.
